radxa-system-config (0.4.0) jammy; urgency=medium

  We have moved most of rbuild's config files into radxa-system-config. This is
  done to provide finer-grained control of the configuration packages.

  When you upgrade your system, you might see some config conflicts. This is
  expected behaviour.
